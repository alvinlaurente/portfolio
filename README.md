# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This website made with pure HTML, CSS, & jQuery. Credit for some works and libraries that I used below.

### Credits :

1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).
For the most part, I used Bootstrap's layouts.
2. [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) by **_Ken Wheeler_**.
Of course for carousel. Repository link : https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick
3. [Vanilla LazyLoad](https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/vanilla-lazyload/) by **_Andrea Verlicchi_**.
I used this library to make polyfill ([Intersection Observer](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver)) lazyload components. Repository link : https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload
